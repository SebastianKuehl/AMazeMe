# About Software

The code of this project was written as part of developing a prototype for evaluating a study thesis. Therefore the code has unfortunately been rushed down in order to get a working prototype to work with. It is not optimized by any means and a lot of things could have been done more easily by leveraging the unity editor.

We have the vision to come back to this project sometime to continue and improve it. Meanwhile we wanted to give interested people the chance to make their own features, thus adding or improving this prototype/game. Some ideas of us were:
* AI: We started working on an AI, a skull floating through the labyrinth. At the moment it is doing random walk and not interacting with the player. The skull could be a thread or key to the player to solve the maze or other mysteries.
* Hammer: Using the (right) vive controller, the vr-player can summon a hammer. Our idea was to use this hammer as a weapon against an AI or as a method to clear obstacles in the maze.
* Objects in maze: are not interactable. We visioned adding some interaction for the vr-player, possibly for solving another puzzle or grasping a hint.

# About the game

AMaze Me is a game created as part of a project at the Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany. We are two master students of computer science and have developed this game as a continuation of our prototype. The aim of the prototype was to investigate how the outsourcing of control in VR games affects both players. This game is not finished, probably prone to many bugs and has a few features not fully or at all implemented.

## Regarding VR and controllers

This game has been developed with a HTC Vive and controllers. We added the option for removing the controller-functionality, which is in the play menu. The headlight, previously controlled with a controller, is now mounted to the head mounted display. You can use Riftcat and VRRidge to play this game via your smartphone and without controllers.

## How to play

After starting the game, one player plays on a pc using the keyboard and mouse whilst the other uses the VR headset. The player on the pc controls the player in vr by using the "w,a,s,d"-keys and "spacebar" to confirm his actions. The player in the vr-world can only be teleported in line and not diagonally through the maze. Further he can use the mouse to control the view of the map, scroll in or zoom out and move it around.

The main goal is to find out of the maze. You can leave it once you are at the door with a key. You can find the key by collecting treasure-barrels in the maze. Some barrels are marked on the map. You can change the possibility for marks in the play menu.
